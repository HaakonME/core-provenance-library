  1. Required packages on Ubuntu
----------------------------------

Please make sure that the following packages are installed:
  python-dev
  swig


  2. Limitations
------------------

The bindings have been tested only on Linux (more specifically, on Ubuntu).
They have not been tested on OS X, and they have not yet been ported to
Microsoft Windows.


  3. Design
-------------

The Python bindings are implemented as two separate packages:
  1. CPLDirect, which is automatically generated by SWIG from the public
     include files of the C bindings using ../cpl.i as the interface
  2. CPL, a Perl-like API wrapper around CPLDirect
