  1. Required packages on Ubuntu
----------------------------------

Please make sure that the following packages are installed:
  default-jdk
  swig


  2. Compiling and installing the Java bindings
-------------------------------------------------

If you plan to use the CPL bindings via Maven, please do the following:
  cd bindings/java      (if necessary)
  make release
  sudo make -C CPLDirect install
  make -C CPL maven-install

The Maven group ID is edu.harvard.pass, and the artifact ID is cpl. You can
find the most recent version of the project by examining CPL/Makefile.

To use the bindings by manually including the .jar or to use with Ant:
  cd bindings/java      (if necessary)
  make release
  sudo make install

This will (among other things) create /usr/local/java/CPL.jar, which you can
then include in your project. You do not need to include CPLDirect.jar, since
it is statically included in CPL.jar.

Note: If "make release" fails with the "Permission denied" error, please run
"sudo make distclean" first.


  3. Limitations
------------------

The bindings have been tested only on Linux (more specifically, on Ubuntu).
They have not been tested on OS X, and they have not yet been ported to
Microsoft Windows.


  4. Design
-------------

The Java language bindings are implemented as two separate packages:
  1. CPLDirect, which is automatically generated by SWIG from the public
     include files of the C bindnings using ../cpl.i as the interface
  2. CPL, a Java-like API wrapper around CPLDirect
