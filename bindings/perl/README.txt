  1. Required packages on Ubuntu
----------------------------------

Please make sure that the following packages are installed:
  libperl-dev
  swig


  2. Limitations
------------------

The bindings have been tested only on Linux (more specifically, on Ubuntu).
They have not been tested on OS X, and they have not yet been ported to
Microsoft Windows.


  3. Design
-------------

The Perl bindings are implemented as two separate packages:
  1. CPLDirect, which is automatically generated by SWIG from the public
     include files of the C bindnings using ../cpl.i as the interface
  2. CPL, a Perl-like API wrapper around CPLDirect

Error handling: CPL public API functions throw errors using the croak command
from the Carp package, which is similar to die. To catch it, use either the
eval block or the try/catch blocks from the Error package.
